Hey, It's been a while since the last release of smallweb! I've been taking a break for the month of August, but I'm back with the biggest smallweb release yet, including:

- Protecting private apps with authentication
- Built-in admin services
- CLI entrypoints

<!-- more -->

## Authentication

Smallweb now supports token based authentication for private apps. Enabling it is simple:

1. Add a token field to your global `config.json` file

    ```json
    {
        "tokens": [
            "my-secret-token"
        ]
    }
    ```

    You can easily generate a new token with the `smallweb token` command.

1. Set the `private` field to true in your app config.

    ```json
    // ~/smallweb/example-app/smallweb.json
    {
        "private": true
    }
    ```

From now on, you will need to provide a valid token whenever you want to access the app.

If you access the app from the browser, you'll see a login prompt. If you access it programmatically, you can provide the token in the `Authorization` header.

```sh
curl https://example-app.localhost --header "Authorization: Bearer my-secret-token"
```

In the future, I want to add support an `email` based authentication mechanism, inspired by [https://lastlogin.io/](https://lastlogin.io/).

## Built-in Admin Apps

This new authentication mechanism enabled me to distribute admin services as part of smallweb. In this release, there are two admin apps available:

- `webdav.<your-domain>`: A WebDAV server to manage your files
- `cli.<your-domain>`: Allowing you to access the cli from your browser

### webdav service

I've been rediscovering the power of WebDAV recently, and I wanted to make it easy to pair it with smallweb. The built-in webdav servers allows you to manage/backup your smallweb folder using any webdav client.

It means that smallweb can now be integrated with:

- All major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
- Web based file managers (ex: <https://www.filestash.app/>)

To authenticate, you can either:

- Use bearer token authentication
- Use basic authentication, and provide the token as the **username**

Currently the WebDAV server does not comes with any UI, as I was not able to find a webdav client both easily embeddable and good-looking. If you have any suggestion, feel free to reach out!

### cli service

You can now access the cli from your browser! This is a great way to manage your smallweb instance from your phone or tablet.

The cli is protected behind the same authentication mechanism as the rest of the apps.

You pass args to the cli by using path parameters. You can also use query parameters to pass options. For example, to run the `smallweb ls --json` command, you can go to `https://cli.<your-domain>/ls?json`. Or you can preview the logs as they come in by going to `https://cli.<your-domain>/logs?f`.

Currently, the cli just output plain text, but in a future release, I might add support for richer outputs using xterm.js.

## Updated permissions

You used to be able to customize the permissions of a smallweb app using the `permissions` field in the app config. There was a big issue with this approach: if an app had write access to the filesystem, it could edit it's own permissions, and escalate its privileges.

In this release, app permissions are now longer customizable. Instead, each smallweb app is allowed to:

- read and write in its own directory
- access the network using the fetch API
- access the env variable defined either in the global config or in the `.env` file

If you want to give you app additional permission, you can provide it with a token has an environment variable.

```sh
# ~/smallweb/example-app.env
SMALLWEB_TOKEN=my-secret-token
```

Then, you'll be able to access the cli from your app:

```ts
const token = Deno.env.get("SMALLWEB_TOKEN");

const resp = await fetch("https://cli.<your-domain>/ls?json", {
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    }
});

const apps = await resp.json();
```

Or build your own smallweb editor using a [WebDAV client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdav)!

## CLI entrypoints

Smallweb apps are required to export an object, as their default export, that contain's a `fetch` method to handle incoming requests.

```ts
// ~/smallweb/example-app/main.ts
export default {
    fetch: async (request: Request) => {
        return new Response('Hello, World!');
    }
}
```

From now on, you can also register a `run` method to handle cli commands.

```ts
// ~/smallweb/example-app/main.ts
export default {
    fetch: async (request: Request) => {
        return new Response('Hello, World!');
    },
    run: async (args: string[]) => {
        console.log(`Hello, ${args[0]}!`);
    }
}
```

Once you have registered a `run` method, you can run it with the `smallweb run` command.

```console
$ smallweb run example-app pomdtr
Hello, pomdtr!
```

These cli entrypoints are also leveraged for cron tasks (which schema has been updated in this release).

```json
// ~/smallweb/example-app/smallweb.json
{
    "crons": [
        {
            "name": "say-hello-to-pomdtr",
            "description": "Say hello to pomdtr every day",
            "schedule": "0 0 * * *",
            "args": ["pomdtr"]
        }
    ]
}
```

## `smallweb types` command

With the addition of the `run` method, it can become a bit cumbersome to check that your default export is compatible with the expected smallweb schema.

I added a new `smallweb types` command to help you generate types hint.

To add the smallweb types to your project, run:

```sh
smallweb types > smallweb.d.ts
```

You can then reference them in your project:

```ts
export default {
    fetch: async (request) => {
        return new Response('Hello, World!');
    },
    run: async (args) => {
        console.log(`Hello, ${args[0]}!`);
    }
} satisfies Smallweb.App;
```

## Simplified Global Configuration

The global configuration now has the following schema:

```json
// ~/.config/smallweb/config.json
{
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 8080,
    "domain": "smallweb.run",
    "dir": "~/smallweb",
    "tokens": [
        "my-secret-token"
    ],
}
```

All of these fields can also be provided using environment variables (ex: `host` can be provided using the `SMALLWEB_HOST` environment variable).

As you can see, the complex domain rooting from previous versions has been dropped. A smallweb instance maps a single wildcard domain to a single directory. If you want to manage multiple domains, feel free to run multiple instances of smallweb!

You can still attach a custom domain to a specific app by adding a `CNAME` file in the app directory, containing the domain you want to attach.

## Update app config

The schema of the smallweb config was updated:

```json
{
    "private": true,
    "entrypoint": "main.ts",
    "root": "public",
    "crons": []
}
```

We already detailed above:

- The addition of the `private` field
- The removal of the `permissions` field
- The update of the `crons` field

In addition to this:

- the `serve` field was replaced by the `entrypoint` field. You can use it to specify which file exports the app object. If you don't provide it, smallweb will default to `main.[js,ts,jsx,tsx]`.
- the `root` field allows you to specify the root directory of the app. The `entrypoint` file will be resolved relative to this directory.

Smallweb no longer serve static files by default. If you want to serve static files, you can use the following main.ts:

```ts
// ~/smallweb/example-app/main.ts
import { serveDir } from "jsr:@std/http/file-server";

export default {
  fetch: (req: Request) => serveDir(req, {
    // The root directory of the app
    fsRoot: "./static",
  }),
}
```
