Smallweb `0.14` is the first release approaching the vision I had for the project when I started it.

It includes a lot of new features, but almost no breaking changes, which is a good sign that the project is maturing.

<!-- more -->

## Admin / REST API

You can now manage your apps using a new REST API.

You'll need to assign a subdomain to it:

```json
// ~/smallweb/api/smallweb.json
{
    "entrypoint": "smallweb:api",
    "private": true,
    "publicRoutes": [
        "/openapi.json",
        "/schemas/app.schema.json",
        "/schemas/config.schema.json",
    ]
}
```

Note that:

- There is a new kind of entrypoint, with a `smallweb:` specifier.
- We protect the API with the `private` flag.
- We expose some key routes to the public, like the OpenAPI schema.

Currently the API includes a limited set of endpoints, but it will be expanded in the future.

There are also some endpoints which are not documented in the OpenAPI schema:

- a `/webdav` endpoint to manage your files using WebDAV (this replaces `https://webdav.<your-domain>`)
- json schemas for app and global config (`/schemas/app.schema.json` and `/schemas/config.schema.json`)

Of course, it's quite easy to generate a client for the API using the OpenAPI schema. I recommend using [fets](https://the-guild.dev/openapi/fets/client/quick-start), as it does not require any code generation.

```ts
import { createClient, type NormalizeOAS } from 'npm:fets'
import type openapi from 'jsr:@smallweb/openapi@0.14.0'

const client = createClient<NormalizeOAS<typeof openapi>>({
    endpoint: '<your-domain>',
    globalParams: {
        headers: {
            Authorization: 'Bearer <your-token>'
        }
    }
})

const response = await client['/v0/apps'].get()

console.log(response.json()) // typed!
```

You can generate a token for the API using the `smallweb token create` command.

```sh
smallweb token create -d "api token" --app api
```

Note the new `--app` flag, which allows you to scope the token to a specific app (or multiple ones).

You can also interact with the API using the `smallweb` cli, which allows you to bypass authentication.

```sh
# smallweb api -X <method> -H <header> -d <data> <path>
smallweb api -X GET /v0/apps
```

## Automatic ts/jsx/tsx compilation in static sites

When your app does not include a `main.[js,jsx,ts,tsx]` file, smallweb default to serve it as a static site.

From now on, smallweb will automatically compile your typescript and jsx files to javascript, meaning that you can just reference them in your html files.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- This will be compiled to index.js -->
    <script src="index.ts"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

If your static website includes a main.ts file, you can force the serving of static assets by creating a `smallweb.json`:

```json
{
    "entrypoint": "smallweb:static"
}
```

## Removal of the smallweb terminal

I'm not super happy with the smallweb terminal, and I think it's a bit too much of a gimmick. I might revisit it in the future, but for now I'm removing it.

If you were using it, you can easily recreate it as a smallweb app using [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) and the new `/v0/run/<app>` endpoint from the api.

## Improved Logs

You might have spotted it in the api specs, but smallweb includes some new endpoints to manage logs.

If you try connecting to them, you'll see a stream of json logs coming in.

You can easily connect this to a log management system like [datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), or [sentry](https://sentry.io/).

But if you just want to see the logs in your terminal, you can use the `smallweb log` command.

```sh
# view all http requests
smallweb log http
# view all cron jobs
smallweb log cron
# view stdout/stderr output of your smallweb apps
smallweb log console
```

## Embedded Docs

Smallweb now embeds it's own documentation in the binary, meaning that you can self-host it, and have your own version of the docs that matches your version of smallweb.

```json
// ~/smallweb/docs/smallweb.json
{
    "entrypoint": "smallweb:docs"
}
```

## CLI Changes

I added a few new commands to the smallweb cli to help you manage your apps.

- `smallweb create <app>` to create a new app (replaces `smallweb init`)
- `smallweb rename <old> <new>` to rename an app
- `smallweb delete <app>` to delete an app
- `smallweb fork <source> <target>` to duplicate an app

There is also a new `smallweb changelog` command to view the changelog of smallweb.

`smallweb edit` is now deprecated, but you can easily recreate it using a [smallweb plugin](https://docs.smallweb.run/guides/plugins.html).

## What's next ?

A bunch of things!

Now that I have onboarded quite a few users, I've noticed that nearly everyone struggles with wiring their domain to a smallweb instance using cloudflare worker. I want to start working on an optional managed version of smallweb, which would make it easier to get familiar with the tool before doing a full self-hosted deployment.

Smallweb pairs really well with [mutagen](https://mutagen.io/), and mutagen has some support for [beeing embedded](https://mutagen.io/documentation/introduction/daemon#embedding).

Now that smallweb is more mature, I really want to expand the community of users. If you're aware of any communities that might be interested in smallweb, please let me know! I would love to do a demo for them.

I have found a good way to distribute apps using smallweb on JSR (see [@smallweb/excalidraw](https://jsr.io/@smallweb/excalidraw)), and I want to package a bunc of them this way.

Now that we have a rest API, it's quite easy to connect smallweb to other tools. I have started working on a raycast integration, a telegram bot and a vscode extension, and I'll share them with you as soon as they are ready.

I plan to create an adapter for [astro](https://astro.build/), which would allow you to use smallweb as a backend for your astro apps.
