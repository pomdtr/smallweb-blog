Smallweb is still WIP, so I'm discovering new ways to use it every weeks. But in the past month, I've found a setup I'm satisfied with, so I'm sharing it here.

This article is inspired by [nydg article](https://www.smallweb.ndyg.co/) about his own setup using [Sidepro](https://sidepro.cloud).

I'll try to update this article each time I discover something new.

## Hosting smallweb

I host all of the websites under the `smallweb.run` domain on a 5$ Hetzner VPS. The setup script I used is quite simple:

```sh
# create user with homedir and default shell
useradd --system --user-group --create-home --shell $(which bash) smallweb.run

# set a password for the smallweb user
passwd smallweb.run

# give the user sudo access (optional)
usermod -aG sudo smallweb.run

# allow the user to use systemd
usermod -aG systemd-journal smallweb.run

# run user services on login
loginctl enable-linger smallweb.run

# install unzip (required for deno)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install unzip

# install deno
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh # install deno

# install smallweb
curl -sSfL https://install.smallweb.run | sh # install smallweb

# start the smallweb service
smallweb service install
```

Each smallweb instance get it's own user. Currently, I have two of them: `smallweb.run` and `pomdtr.me`, and I can easily switch between them using ssh:

```sh
# connect to the smallweb.run user
ssh smallweb.run@<vps-ip>
# list smallweb.run websites
smallweb ls
exit

# connect to the pomdtr.me user
ssh pomdtr.me@<vps-ip>
# list pomdtr.me websites
smallweb ls
exit
```

An alias in my `~/.ssh/config` file allows me to easily connect to my VPS:

```txt
Host smallweb.run
  HostName <vps-ip>
  User smallweb.run

Host pomdtr.me
  HostName <vps-ip>
  User pomdtr.me
```

Allowing me to just do `ssh smallweb.run` to get a shell.

## Wiring my server to cloudflare

I use cloudflare as my DNS provider. In order to proxy request to my smallweb instance, I installed `cloudflared` on my VPS, and created a tunnel for each of my smallweb instance.

I'm not really satisfied with this setup, and I want to switch to caddy at some point. Last time I tried, I had some issues setup up wildcard certificates, and quickly gave up.

## Syncing my smallweb folder using mutagen

On my laptop, I use [mutagen](https://mutagen.io/) to sync between my local folder and the remote one. It's incredibly fast, and I can work on my smallweb instance as if it was local.

You can setup mutagen with 3 commands:

```sh
# install mutagen
brew install mutagen-io/mutagen/mutagen
# make sure the daemon is running, and start at boot
mutagen daemon register
# create a sync session
mutagen sync create --name smallweb-run ~/smallweb/smallweb.run smallweb.run@<vps-ip>:/home/smallweb.run/smallweb --ignore_vcs --ignore=node_modules
```

The `.git` folders are not synced by mutagen, and I run every git command directly on my laptop. VCS systems should not be synced between devices, as it can lead to conflicts.


I organize my smallweb folder like this:

```txt
/Users/pomdtr/smallweb
├── localhost
├── pomdtr.me
└── smallweb.run
```

The `localhost` folder contains a local instance of smallweb (accessible at `*.localhost`). `smallweb.run` and `pomdtr.me` are synced with my VPS. To move apps between instances, I can just drag and drop them in the folder I want.

I code using my local instance of VS Code, and each change is instantly synced. For example, I'm currrently writing this article from `~/smallweb.run/blog-preview`. When I run `deno task build`, I can instantly preview the article at `https://blog-preview.smallweb.run`.

In order to access the smallweb cli, I created a little wrapper script at `~/.local/bin/smallweb.run`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# shellcheck disable=SC2088
exec ssh -t -o LogLevel=QUIET smallweb.run '~/.local/bin/smallweb' "$@"
```

It allows me to run `smallweb.run ls` from my terminal, as if the cli was installed locally. The only issue with this method is that you don't get completions.

## Editing websites from phone/tablet

In order to edit websites from my phone, I use the webdav server built-in to smallweb, associated with [Material Files](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zhanghai.android.files&hl=en_US).

On my tablet, I make use of [Blink Shell](https://blink.sh/) to ssh into my VPS, and edit files using [kakoune](https://kakoune.org/).

But you have a plethory of options! I'm investigating bundling a vscode instance into smallweb, so you can edit your files from your browser.
